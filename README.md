  - [ ] Steps to recreate: Went to a site https://baraktawily.blogspot.fr/2018/02/how-to-dos-29-of-world-wide-websites.html to learn how to attack my WordPress site.
 Used the doser.py to attack my WordPress and I put that file on my desktop in Linux.
  I pasted a long script from the site onto the commandline in Linux but changed the script so that it pointed to my WordPress site.
  Then I loaded the doser.py and went back to my script.  When I executed the script, I went to WordPress and I found that I couldn't manipulate the site anymore.
